# engage_api_py3
Essential tools for accessing the Engage Integration API with Python3.

## Summary
This is a collection of Python3 apps that we've used for Salsa's Engage clients. The doc
is really thin (sorry) and on our list to fix up.

The hard work is done by sources in the "pkg" directory.  That contains the 
basic tools that you'll need to connect to Enage via Python.

## Caution

Only a few apps use the pkg classes right now.  Mostly they are models
of Engage behaviors.  Tred carefully...

## Note

Use Python version 3.  Python2 served us well for over 20 years, but not it's gone.
